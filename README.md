Cabadonga - Movie CRUD API
Overview
This project is an Express API that manages a movie database. It allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of movies. Each movie has the following properties:

*id (auto-generated, number) *title (string, required) *director (string, required) *year (number, required) *genre (string, required) The API is connected to a MySQL database for data persistence.

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone cd CABADONGA-API-CRUDACTIVITY

Initialize npm and install dependencies:
npm init -y npm install express mysql2 body-parser

Create the MySQL database and populate it with sample data:
CREATE DATABASE movie_db; USE movie_db;

CREATE TABLE movies ( id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, director VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, year INT NOT NULL, genre VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL );

INSERT INTO movies (title, director, year, genre) VALUES ('The Shawshank Redemption', 'Frank Darabont', 1994, 'Drama');

INSERT INTO movies (title, director, year, genre) VALUES ('Fight Club', 'David Fincher', '1999', 'Drama');
